# Chapter 4 The Theory of Relativity

In a span of about 12 years, Albert Einstein produced two theories that brought about a fundamental change in our understanding of space, time, matter and energy. The results that he obtained are so profoundly counterintuitive that they cannot be fully grasped without the help of rather Sophisticated mathematics. In the following sections, we will describe this formalism in some detail, and will consider a number of key results that follow from it. Before we do that, however, it may be helpful to briefly describe some of the most important implications of special and general relativity.

Einstein’s theory of special relativity grew out of two remarkably simple postulates, which can be paraphrased as follows:

### Postulate 1.  
The laws of physics must be identical for all observers moving at constant velocities.

### Postulate 2.  
The speed of light is the same for all observers moving at constant velocities.

The first of these postulates is not particularly surprising, since we intuitively expect that the laws of nature ought to be independent of the coordinate system from which they are observed. The second one, however, appears to be at odds with our everyday experience, which suggests that objects moving toward us appear faster, while those moving away seem to be slower. There was no apparent reason to assume that light would be the lone exception to this rule. And yet, Einstein's bold conjecture turned out to be correct, and ultimately lead to some remarkable discoveries. 

Special relativity makes extensive use of the so-called Lorentz transformation, which establishes a precise mathematical connection between measurements made by observers who are in relative motion. One of the key assumptions behind this transformation is that two observers will record *different times* and *different spatial locations* for the same event. This is quite unlike the paradigm used in classical physics, where time is identical for all observers (although the spatial coordinates that they register may vary).

A particularly interesting property of the Lorentz transformation is that the the position $$x_A$$ recorded by observer A generally depends on *both* the time *and* 
the position recorded by observer B (the same holds true for $$t_A$$ as well). The fact that temporal and spatial coordinates somehow become “entangled” as we move from one frame of reference to another has far-reaching consequences. Among other things, it suggests that we must forgo our natural tendency to treat space and time as separate entities, and should instead view them as components of a unified four dimensional *spacetime*.

Although the Lorentz transformation is just a mathematical operation, it turns out that it has some very real physical manifestations, One of the best known examples of this kind is the so-called *Lorentz contraction*, which implies that a stationary observer will record a shorter length for an object than his moving counterpart. In the extreme case when the object moves at the speed of light relative to the observer, it becomes impossible to distinguish between “front” and “back”. 

An even more striking illustration of the way in which Lorentz transformation alter our conventional ideas about time and space is an effect known as *time dilation*, which implies that the time interval recorded by a moving observer will be *shorter* than the one measured by his stationary counterpart. As the speed of the moving observer approaches the speed of light, his clocki will actually trickle down to a halt (which is clearly something that is difficult to imagine without the help of mathematics). 

Einstein's theory of gravity (which goes by the name of general relativity) poses a different sort of challenge to our intuition. One of its most important claims is that space is actually an *active* entity, and not a mere “container” through which material objects move. Einstein’s conjecture was that spacetime and matter *interact*, and that this process can be described in precise mathematical terms. According to this hypothesis, spacetime becomes warped in the presence of matter (or energy), and its geometric form is determined by the way in which the masses are distributed. In such a framework, the notion of a gravitational “force” becomes obsolete, since the trajectory of a physical object is dictated by the curvature of spacetime. 

The idea that space is curved is not all that difficult to grasp, since we happen to be living on the surface of a sphere (which is definitely not flat). Curved time, on the other hand, is much harder to imagine, since we have no similar experiences in our daily lives. In order to do this, we must first reconcile ourselves to the possibility that time can flow faster or slower, depending on the local geometric properties. Einstein's theory predicts, for example, that time will “słow down” for us if we happen to be in the vicinity of a massive object (where spacetime is significantly curved). As we move away from it, the curvature of spacetime becomes less pronounced, and our clocks will run faster.

Perhaps the most remarkable feature of general relativity is the fact that it provides a mathematical framework for studying the universe as a whole. It goes without saying, of course, that such a framework is necessarily incomplete, since there is no way to accurately describe a system of such complexity. Nevertheless, Einstein's equations allow us to formulate a meaningful approximate model of the universe, and to make certain predictions. It is interesting to note, however, that this model also points to the existence of truths which will necessarily remain unknown to us. A typical example of this sort is the recognition that some remote parts of the universe may have laws and constants of nature that are very different from the ones we are familiar with. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), this is something that we will never be able to verify, since these regions are now permanently beyond our visible horizon.

To understand why this is a realistic possibility, we need to briefly describe a cosmological model proposed by physicist Alan Guth, which is Commonly referred to as *inflation theory*. Guth suggested that the universe emerged from a miniscule “nugget” of spacetime which consisted of locally uniform “patches”. He then found a solution of Einstein’s equations that allows for a brief period of exponential expansion, during which each “patch” experienced a dramatic increase in size (this supposedly occurred in the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang). According to inflation theory, the part of the universe that we now inhabit most probably originated from a tiny segment of the primordial “nugget” which was small enough for particles to interact and homogenize. Such a prediction is certainly consistent with our astronomical data, which suggest that the “observable” universe is remarkably uniform in every respect. It is entirely possible, however, that the other “patches” had very different physical properties, and that the regions which grew out of them are nothing like our own. Given that no information from these regions will ever reach us (due to the expansion of the universe), the only thing that we can say with any reliability is that is that our theories and mathematical models apply *locally*.

Another intriguing consequence of Einstein's general relativity is the existence of black holes. Since the entire mass of these unusual heavenly bodies is crushed to the size of a point, the curvature of spacetime at their center approaches infinity (this extreme scenario is commonly referred as a *singularity*). Within a certain region around the singularity, the pull of gravity is so strong that nothing can escape, not even light. This property clearly places a limit on what we can know about such objects, since it becomes impossible to acquire empirical information about processes that take place in their interior. It is interesting to note, however, that our ignorance on this subject is actually a very good thing, since the same “shielding effect” that prevents us from fully understanding black holes also prohibits them from influencing the outside World. If it were not for this restriction, black holes would directly affect the area around them, and our universe would be a very different (and undoubtedly far less hospitable) place.

In the following sections, we will examine some of these questions in greater detail. We will first consider special relativity, and summarize some of its most important results. We will then turn our attention to general relativity, and describe how gravity can be analyzed in the framework of differential geometry.
