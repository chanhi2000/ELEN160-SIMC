# Chapter 1 Chaos Theory

The phenomenon of chaos was first observed in 1961, by meteorologist Edward Lorenz. While studying a simple model for weather prediction, Lorenz noticed that repeated computer simulations produced very different results, although all the relevant system parameters appeared to be unchanged. After carefully examining all the possibilities, he ultimately established that the discrepancy was caused by minute rounding errors in the initial conditions (at the fifth decimal place). This was a thoroughly unexpected conclusion, since the underlying equations were deterministic, and should therefore be insensitive to such small variations. Lorenz subsequently named this phenomenon the “butterfly effect”, a term that underscores the possibility that something as insignificant as the movement of a butterfly’ wings could ultimately affect global weather patterns.

To understand why this result was so surprising, we should note that until the early 1960s physical processes were routinely classified as either deterministic or uncertain, but never both at once. The dynamic behavior of deterministic systems was assumed to be completely predictable, provided that all the parameters and initial conditions were known with sufficient accuracy. It was believed, in other words, that small changes in the initial conditions should not have a noticeable effect on the system trajectories. The model that Lorenz discovered clearly violated this premise, since it showed that precise mathematical models needn't always give rise to orderly behavior.

The realization that deterministic systems can sometimes exhibit unpredictable dynamics has important consequences for our understanding of science and its methods of investigation. To begin with, chaos theory shows that there are phenomena that do not lend themselves to repeated experimentation, since even the most minute variations in their surroundings can completely alter the outcome of the measurement. It goes without saying, of course, that such variations are unavoidable, even in a strictly controlled environment. To this we should add the observation that the hypersensitivity of such systems to initial conditions makes it impossible to accurately simulate their long term behavior. Eliminating (or even minimizing) significant long term errors would require *mited precision, which obviously cannot be accomplished in practice. It is therefore entirely appropriate to conclude that we can never have complete knowledge of such systems, regardless of how sophisticated our technology becomes.

Chaotic systems also challenge our intuitive no implicitly assumes a certain level of regularity and predictability. To see why this is so, we should note that some systems of this type exhibit a property known as intermittency, which allows for sudden and completely unexpected aperiodic bursts that interrupt long periods of orderly behavior. Since these conceivable systems behave in the “usual” way both before and after such events, it is dynamic pattern, with no idea that other patterns are even possible. And yet, the underlying equations clearly allow for such anomalies, although they cannot predict when (or if) they will occur. Under such circumstances, it is quite possible that we may have to change our conventional understanding of physical laws, and reevaluate the extent to which they are "binding”. Indeed, chaos theory suggests that laws governing complex systems may not be prescriptive, and can instead be viewed as a set of constraints, which determine what is and what is not possible. The details, however, will necessarily remains unknown to us.

Based on what we have learned about complex systems in recent decades, it seems that the laws governing their behavior are quite “liberal,” an almost unlimited variety of configurations. This apparent “freedom” which is tempered by certain fairly moderate restrictions plays a crucial role in the process of self-organization. Current research suggests that (both of the animate and inanimate variety) seem to “prefer” operating in this mode, where small environmental changes can lead to the emergence of a new and unprecedented natural forms. Behavior of this sort (which resembles o dynamics of systems that are on the "edge” of chaos) is seen by many as an essential prerequisite for the process of biological evolution.

In the sections that follow, we will examine some of these issues in greater detail. Such an analysis will require the use of nonlinear differential equations, as well as some elements of stability theory. In order to sary concepts, we will begin with a brief overview of linear systems and their properties. We will then turn our attention to more sophisticated topics such as strange attractors, bifurcations and intermittency. Our discussion will conclude with two case  studies, which illustrate how chaos arises in realistic physical systems.
